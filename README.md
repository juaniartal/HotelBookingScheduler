## 2. Backend (Node.js + Express)

### 2.1. Navigate to the Backend Folder

First, navigate to the `backend` directory:

```bash
cd backend

```

### 2.2. Install Dependencies
You need all those juicy backend dependencies? Donâ€™t worry, we got you covered. Just run:

```bash
npm install

```
This command will install everything defined in the package.json file in the backend directory. It's like grocery shopping, but for your codebase. ðŸ›’


### 2.3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the backend folder and configure the required variables. You can use the .env.example file as a reference for the environment variables. Make sure to set up any database credentials, API keys, or other configurations required by your application.

###2.4. Start the Backend Server

Ready to turn on the magic? Run the following to start the backend server:

```bash

npm start
```
The backend will be available at http://localhost:8080 (or the port configured in the .env file).

## 3. Frontend (React + Vite)

###3.1. Navigate to the Frontend Folder

Now, letâ€™s switch gears and head to the frontend directory. Donâ€™t worry, it's just a different folder. ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

```bash

cd frontend

```

### 3.2. Install Dependencies
You didn't think the frontend would just work on its own, did you? You gotta install the necessary dependencies, too!

```bash

npm install

```

This command grabs all the frontend dependencies defined in package.json. It's like getting your React app all dressed up for the party. ðŸŽ‰

###3.3. Start the Frontend Server

Itâ€™s go-time! To fire up the frontend development server, just run:


```bash

npm run dev


```

The frontend will be live at http://localhost:(PORT IN TERMINAL OUTPUT).
